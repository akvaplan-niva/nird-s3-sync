NIRD S3 Sync
============

This component is intended to be used for getting data from **NIRD** (Sigma2)
through their `S3-like
API <https://documentation.sigma2.no/files_storage/nird/s3.html>`_. No processing
of the copied data is involved here. The data in the *NIRD S3 bucket* can be
removed after that it is copied successfully to another location. Maybe it will
be an option one can control when the job starts.
